Example 1 : Consider the following 3 activities sorted by
by finish time.
     start[]  =  {10, 12, 20};
     finish[] =  {20, 25, 30};
A person can perform at most two activities. The 
maximum set of activities that can be executed 
is {0, 2} [ These are indexes in start[] and 
finish[] ]

Example 2 : Consider the following 6 activities 
sorted by by finish time.
     start[]  =  {1, 3, 0, 5, 8, 5};
     finish[] =  {2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 9};
A person can perform at most four activities. The 
maximum set of activities that can be executed 
is {0, 1, 3, 4} [ These are indexes in start[] and 
finish[] ]
